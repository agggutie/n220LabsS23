Ever Larger

Setup the canvas

Need a global (technically dont) variable for the diamater of the circle

Need a for loop to increase my initial diamater of 1 by 1 every frame until it reaches 200

When it reaches 200 I need the diameter variable to be set to 1 (thinking an if-else)


Draw a circle in the center of the screen
